Hi, I'm Nikki.  I'm a software engineer and technology manager located in San Diego (but working remotely for companies across America).  My [LinkedIn][] is the most up-to-date place to read about my experience.  

When I'm not writing code, I climb rocks, fight people in Krav Maga, and take my [bulldog][] to the park.
