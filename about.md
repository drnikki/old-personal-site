Hi, I'm Nikki.  I'm a software engineer and PhD student in Tempe, AZ.  If you're curious about my engineering experience, check out my [LinkedIn][].

I'm an active open source volunteer and community organizer. In 2016, I founded the <a href="http://drupaldiversity.com">Drupal Diversity Working Group</a> as a response to the abysmal lack of diversity in the Drupal community. In 2017, I started the <a href="https://github.com/drnikki/open-demographics">Open Demographics Initiative</a>, as a response to watching communities struggle with how to manage their participant demographic data.   

Academically, I'm interested in the answers to a few questions:
- what makes open source communities healthy and safe (especially for under-represented groups)?
- how can we help software engineers act ethically as individuals and community members?
- what deliberate pedagogical interventions can community organizers take to help participants think critically about their ethical options?

If you're also interested in any of the above, I'd love to talk to you.

When I'm not writing code, I climb rocks, do improv, and take my [bulldog][] to the park.
