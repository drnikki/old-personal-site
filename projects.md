## Open demographics

The Open Demographics project is an open-source project designed to help people and teams ask questions about demographic data (gender, sexual orientation, race).  It uses an open source paradigm (community sourced, publicly accessible) to generate a collective consensus on the most inclusive ways to ask questions.  This project is not without it's own political shortcomings and challenges - it's in English, and most contributors are based in the United States.  The community is working to enhance it and expand it to other regions.

Outcomes: This project, in concert with the <a href="http://www.drupal.org/project/gender">Gender Field</a> project on Drupal.org has resulted in more inclusive questioning for over _one million_ Drupal.org users.  Check out the <a href="https://dri.es/offering-more-inclusive-user-demographic-forms">blog announcement</a> by Dries Buytaert (founder of Drupal).

## Trans-inclusive data model

As the result of both Open Demographics conversations, and other conversations about how to store data collected by inclusive demographic forms.  The trans-inclusive data model (currently under construction) is designed to store name, gender, pronoun information in a context-sensitive way that supports asking questions of the data like "I'm about to call this person at home - what is their name and pronoun there?"
