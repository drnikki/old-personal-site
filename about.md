Hi, I'm Nikki.  I'm a software engineer and technology researcher currently finishing a dissertation about data modeling, surveillance, white supremacy and cisnormativity.  If you're curious about my engineering experience, check out my  [LinkedIn][]; the tl;dr is - Drupal 6,7,8, big-budget projects, architecture, technical manager.
 
#### open source
I'm an active open source volunteer and community organizer. In 2016, I founded the <a href="http://drupaldiversity.com">Drupal Diversity Working Group</a> as a response to the abysmal lack of diversity in the Drupal community. In 2017, I started the <a href="https://github.com/drnikki/open-demographics">Open Demographics Initiative</a>, as a response to watching communities struggle with how to manage their participant demographic data.   In 2018, I stepped down from the <a href="http://drupaldiversity.com">Drupal Diversity Working Group</a>, both because I believe in healthy and transparent leadership transitions, and because I was having concerns about whether D&I is the right approach at all. (I still am, happy to discuss if you'd like.) My current open source involvement is with Open Demographics, a forthcoming trans-inclusive gender data model (more on both on the <a href="/projects">projects</a> page), and a variety of open source conference <a href="/talks">talks</a>.

#### research
I'm a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://sfis.asu.edu/hsd-welcome">Human and Social Dimensions of Science and Technology</a> program at Arizona State University. At parties, I tell people that I study "software engineering, surveillance, and data ethics."  This is a 100% true statement, but if you ask for more detail, I'll tell you that I've been thinking about an overlapping set of questions:
- how does bias get encoded in data? specifically, white supremacy and cis normativity?
- are there ways to intervene in the data/conceptual modeling process that can bias a system toward justice?
- can data be intersectional?  if so, what implications does that have for folks who collect, use, generate data?
- related: what is the nature of data we generate in our normal lives? this is, likely, a career-long data ontology curiosity.  
- what can empower software engineers to act ethically as individuals and community members? (sub question: what would a social justice determined, community oriented, reparations focused, intersectionally-grounded set of ethics for software engineers look like?)
- what, if any, deliberate technological interventions can we make to directly counteract systemic injustices like racism, sexism and ableism?
- _not an academic interest, but a personal one_ what (if anything!) can make open source communities healthy and safe (especially for people who are part of under-represented groups)?

In addition to a seemlingly endless list of questions without easy answers, I'm also engaged in critical speculative software engineering.  This can look variously like hacking, like making comptuters out of not-computer things, like unassembling, and thinking about the technology that will create new worlds.

If you're also interested in any of the above, I'd love to talk to you.
